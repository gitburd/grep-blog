The voice was annoyed.
It said:
"What do you mean, you've never been to Alpha Centauri?
For heaven's sake, mankind, it's only four light-years away, you know.
I'm sorry, but if you can't be bothered to take an interest in local affairs that's your own lookout."
"Energize the demolition beams."
Light poured out of the hatchways.
"I don't know," said the voice on the PA, 
"apathetic bloody planet, I've no sympathy at all."
It cut off.
There was a terrible ghastly silence.
There was a terrible ghastly noise.         
There was a terrible ghastly silence.
The Vogon Constructor Fleet coasted away into the inky starry void.
